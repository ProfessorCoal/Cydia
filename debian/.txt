Working Copy makes it easy to clone from a link or a website in Safari. From the share sheet you pick Open in Working Copy to quickly clone the repository in the app.

If the repository is already available in Working Copy, it is shown without cloning it, and if the link was for a particular file, commit or branch this will be opened inside the app.

You enable this action before first use, by scrolling to the right of the bottom greyscale row of icons and tapping More.
